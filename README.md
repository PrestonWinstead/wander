## Description
Anyone who has visited an unfamiliar city has experienced the disorienting struggle 
of trying to find the things that will interest them while navigating a new public 
transit system in an unfamiliar culture, and possibly in an unfamiliar language. 
Wander is here to help. We implement machine learning algorithms to learn about your
interests and build a trip tailored especially for you. We'll handle the transportation
maps, tell you how much time you should plan for each spot, and give restaurant 
recommendations. All that you have to do is show up and Wander. 

## Usage
This project was designed on Expo and made with create-react-app. We recommend running in expo for development, but use whatever mobile development tools you prefer. Just make sure to run `npm install` and `npm start`.

As always happens with projects, some aspects of this project's appearance changed between its inception and its current state. On the whole, though, this remains accurate.
